# CAP WIC App 2016

As a graduating CS major, I'm just about to embark on my new career for web development/design. Going to such a tight niche conference like the Capital Region WIC would really set on my right path to a good start in my career as a female minority developer in the tech industry.

I recently attended TreeHacks, a hackathon at Stanford and because they tried so hard to fix the diversity problem at most hackathons, 50% of attendees were women. The top prize even went to an all-girls team. This inspires me. I love seeing women succeed and going to a WIC conference would also help me explore companies that care about women being able to lead in the tech industry as well.

I will also note that I'm making it my personal goal this year to attend more tech conferences since I realized that every time I've attended one, it's been ridiculously beneficial to my personal growth.
