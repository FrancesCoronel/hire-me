# Speaking

I've spoken at various conferences, Meetups, and related tech events since 2015. My first ever conference talk was on "Web Design for Developers" and since then I've spoken on topics such as "JS Coding Bootcamps", "So You Want To Be A Wizard", "My Experience with Fullstack Academy", "Why should you pursue a career in coding?", the ACM organization, and the Hour of Code.

An overview of all these talks along with pictures can be found on my website (https://fvcproductions.com/home/services/speaking/). All presentations can be found on my Speaker Deck (https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions) or SlideShare (http://www.slideshare.net/FVCproductions). More conference activity can be found on my Lanyrd (http://lanyrd.com/profile/fvcproductions/).

My personal favorites are "So You Want To Be a Wizard" (https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard-free-code-camp-norfolk) and "Web Design for Developers" (https://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/web-design-innovation-hackathon).
