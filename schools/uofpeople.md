I made this video for a health project in school and I feel this video relates to me not only because it represents my passion for creating visually appealing presentations but also because the video expresses my viewpoint on the double edged qualities technology possesses in society.

1. UoPeople utilizes a peer based learning model. What do you think is the benefit of peer based learning and how would you maximize your fellow students' experience at UoPeople?

Peer based learning is essentially the process of taking one’s experience and adding it to this one grand pool of knowledge that anybody can take from/add to. The pool in question is collective intelligence, a shared intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and collective efforts of many individuals. Collective intelligence is theorized to be where society is heading in terms of consensus decision making, and online education is one of those ideas that’s going to lead us there. To maximize experience, I would contribute questions, answer any feasible questions, and offer online resources I found helpful for the material.

2. What led you to select your program (Computer Science or Business Administration) at University of the People?

In an ideal future, I’m enrolled in a dual degree program for an MBA/MSc. in Artificial Intelligence. Ergo, I want to show potential companies that I’m dedicated to learning just as much the technical as well as financial aspect of technology. To prove that, I want to pursue an Associate’s in Business Administration and gain a foundation in business fundamentals and management theory. This degree is also what many employers look for when considering applicants for management positions, which I where I hope to end up someday.

3. Describe an incident which led you to challenge yourself (academically, emotionally, spiritually, etc)

When I found out how much my parents would have to pay for college I found the real academic challenge I faced was attempting to appreciate a system where I have to pay so much money for something that should be granted to all without such high costs. It seems that if you can't even achieve a BA, you're just a second tier citizen. Yet, if you do achieve a BA, you are most likely many thousands of dollars in debt. To deal with expensive tangible benefits I may or may not receive from college is a very real challenge.



4. Please finish this statement: “Online education is a good match for me because…”

As a Computer Science Major, I understand the potential technology has in providing me high-quality education in a virtual environment. I also understand that with my self-discipline, I’ll able to stick to my online course schedule and am self-motivated enough to finish the degree. Flexibility is also important to me though, since I work in the real estate family business and still have other classes to attend to. Given that I also have thorough experience with taking MOOCs through Coursera, Codecademy, and CodeSchool, it will be easy for me to adapt to the online environment.

5. What makes YOU unique? Please point to specific qualities, hobbies, interests, or talents that highlight your personality and goals.

I, Frances, am a Peruvian-American female who is pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and is striving towards a dual degree in MBA/MSc in CS in the near future. At this point, I've set my heart and soul to pursuing a career specifically within bio-inspired computing fields, just because whenever I learn something new, I feel like a child again, never bored and ever so eager. Also, if don't feel like I'm on the path to contributing to society in some sort of meaningful way, I start feeling extremely desolate and just scared. This is me.

6. Explain what you have done to make your community a better place to live in. Give examples of specific projects you have been involved with over time.

Much of my time in high school was spent with Operation Smile, a worldwide children's charity organization that helps treat facial deformities at no cost. I dedicated over 550 hours to the organization and it is how I got my first leadership positions, attended two international conferences and a medical training workshop, was able to teach students how to present a mission video, and it is how I got the chance to participate as a high school volunteer on a medical mission in Vietnam, where I aided kids in overcoming anxiety and educated their parents on general healthcare.
