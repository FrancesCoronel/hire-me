# MongoDB World App 2016

As a budding front-end web developer who uses the MEAN stack in her everyday work, MongoDB directly addresses the tools and topics I need to learn about. As a developer who uses MongoDB, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skills whenever necessary. It's what I love most about the work I do - the constant change of it all and how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time.

As a graduating CS major, I'm just about to embark on my new career for web development/design. Going to such a tight niche conference like the MongoDB World Conference would really set on my right path to a good start in my career.

I will also note that I'm making it my personal goal this year to attend more tech conferences since I realized that every time I've attended one, it's been ridiculously beneficial to my personal growth.

For my story of diversity, to be honest, I don't have a terribly sad story to share about being a minority in tech except having faced your standard micro-aggressions here and there. *sigh*

HOWEVER, I have faced something not necessarily sad, but downright scary. When I was the only female (not to mention only one of two minorities) speaker at a tech conference I recently attended, I wasn't sad, I was just scared. A sort of "Yikes!" kind of scared because it meant to me that because of their limited representation, I would have to act as the voice of all Hispanic and females. If I didn't represent myself well, the image for the rest of those who looked like me who be demeaned for all the audience members. The next time any of my audience members encountered someone like me, would they look back and think of the impression I made to them? Would I ever be seen as a role model to them? And who is my role model anyways? I can't even say now that I know any famous female Hispanics in the tech world that could serve as my role model.

Maybe I just need to get out more.

# MongoDB Background

I like to dabble with things that ought to be dabbled with.

Well, at least… that’s my slogan.
My “life motto”, if you will.
Might have something to do with human nature in general though, so interpret it as you will.

## Fun Fictional Trivia

1. What exactly is your logo? Is it a heart, a feather, what?? It’s a chocolate dipped strawberry!
2. Myers-Briggs? Kinda pseudoscience, but it’s INTJ.
3. Harry Potter House? I took a quiz and apparently I belong with GRYFFINDOR.
4. If you could work for any company in the world, it would be..? Weyland Industries, hands down.
5. If you were President, what’s the first thing you would do? Get rid of all physical currency. I HATE PAPER.

## If you’re looking for boring stuff, here is a standard list:

- Hispanic
- Female
- Front-end Developer at 80|20 and loving it
- CS major (graduating in 3 years)
- 20 years old as of October 2015
- My name is Frances Coronel.

As a graduating master's student in computer science, I'm just about to embark on my new career for web development/design. Going to such a tight niche conference like the MongoDB World Conference would really set on my right path to a good start in my career.

MongoDB would directly addresses the tools and topics I need to learn about given that I was formally taught in the MEAN stack and have coded out web apps in the past that utilize MongoDB as the database of choice. And as a developer who uses MongoDB, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skills whenever necessary. It's what I love most about the work I do - the constant change of it all and how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time.

I'm a first-generation Peruvian-American female (Latina).

Despite dealing with micro-aggressions and societal stereotypes my whole life, I've managed to keep being my interest very high in the tech field. However, never having anyone to relate to just based off more superficial things (race, gender, cultural background, etc.) can actually be really difficult sometimes.

Within the tech community, there are usually bubbles formed around people of certain backgrounds and for the most part, I tend to not fit into them being Latina. And when you're literally the only female minority or Latina in the room all the time, it starts to feel isolating and discouraging.

There are times when I get really tired of this and become depressed but I always manage to tell myself that this is a field I want to stay in and one I can be successful in as long as I keep at it.

> Tell us about your background. *

I'm a 21 year old Latina developer with a panache for design. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in downtown Chelsea at the Google campus. I personally get a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through my varied skill set.
