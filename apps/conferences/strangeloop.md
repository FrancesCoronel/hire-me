# What are you hoping to gain by attending Strange Loop?

I've been told that talks at Strange Loop can end up feeling very obscure initially and for the most part, you have no idea if you'll be able to really understand everything that's going on but then by the end of the talk, you actually end up learning something quite meaningful. Since the talks at Strange Loop are incredibly diverse, I know there will be a talk on something I know very little about and another on something I feel I'm becoming an expert in.

Another motivator is the fact that Strange Loop is very committed to diversity and has even reached out to Ashe Dryden who is someone I actually know from freelancing for one of her AlterConf conferences in NYC. As a Latina in tech, it's nice to know that everyone can feel included at Strange Loop and that the conference is purposefully designed for inclusiveness.

# Please describe your background. What professional, academic, or extracurricular activities are you involved in, related to your field?

I'm a 21-year-old Latina developer with a panache for design. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in downtown Chelsea at the Google campus. I personally get a lot of personal satisfaction out of helping the local tech community through my varied skill set.

What does "varied skill set" actually imply? Well, I happen to enjoy freelance blogging and freelance web design & development, mentoring folks 1-to-1 and speaking at tech conferences or related events. These are all side hobbies though as my true passion lies in creating charming and constructive products.

In terms of academic backgrounds, I received a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Hampton University May 2016 and have attended various external programs before like Fullstack Academy (web development), Designlab (web design), and Product School (product management).

My past work experience includes first working part-time as a front-end developer while in my last semester at Hampton University at a local consulting agency called 80|20 in Norfolk, VA. Later, I interned as a wearables developer for Accenture Liquid Studio in Redwood City, CA during summer 2016. For Spring 2017, I'm acting as an ambassador for Fullstack Academy.

I am one of the few Latinas I know studying computer science (the only one in my program at Cornell Tech right now even if I'm not mistaken) and because I realized my isolation so long ago, I've had a strong desire from the beginning to want to inspire those who want to come into the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in. Ultimately, my goal lies in becoming a leader in the field in other to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.

# If you’re currently working, tell us about your job.

In December 2016, I took on a role as ambassador for Fullstack Academy, the program I mentioned earlier. It is similar to being a dev evangelist but it doesn’t really require any technical acumen. Just a lot of passion for Fullstack and what it offers. This is a gig where I can make my own hours which is convenient since I'm studying full-time right now. After graduating from Fullstack, I've inspired dozens of students to apply via Quora and my personal blog posts that broad casted my experience of Fullstack Academy when I attended.

# If you’re currently studying, tell us about your school.

Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in downtown Chelsea at the Google campus.

Cornell Tech is the technology-focused campus of Cornell University located in New York City. It serves as a research and graduate-level education institution, offering programs at the professional masters, doctoral and postdoctoral levels. The unique part of the curriculum is that it is meant to be more hands-on and project-based than other MS programs. It's very multi-disciplinary in that I'm taking classes in privacy and security, product management, HCI, design thinking, building a startup, and connective media technologies just this semester alone.

The school was actually dubbed "Silicon Island" by the New Yorker since they're planning on moving to Roosevelt Island this summer so that probably says a lot.

# What professional, academic, or extracurricular activities related to your field are you most proud of?

It's actually very selfishly satisfying to me when I volunteer my time towards mentoring others who are also interested in the tech field which is something I've been doing since 2015.

Generally speaking, I enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and the tech industry in general.

In terms of preparation for coding bootcamps, I’ve helped out folks who have successfully gone on to coding bootcamps like Fullstack Academy, Hack Reactor, and MakerSquare.

I’ve also tutored kids at the elementary, middle, and high school level on how to get started in the tech field through the organization Code.org and female college students through the organization Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York (WiTNY) in collaboration with Cornell Tech.

Since January 2015, I’ve dedicated over 38 hours of my free time (not including training and travel) mentoring awesome people who want to learn more about how to code.

You can even find feedback from my mentoring sessions in the testimonial section of my website if you're so inclined (http://fvcproductions.com/testimonial).
