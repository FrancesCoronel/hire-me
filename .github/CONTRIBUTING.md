## Contributing

Do you have a resource you want to share?

Let’s support each other! 💛

If you have other resources you’d like to recommend, feel free to open a pull request or create an issue.

### Installation

We are using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) as my static site generator to showcase all the resources in this repo.

To get this up and running locally, type in the following commands.

```bash
# It is recommended to install docsify-cli globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

npm i docsify-cli -g

# Run the local server with docsify serve. You can preview the site in your browser on http://localhost:3000.

docsify serve docs
```
