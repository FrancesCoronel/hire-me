# Fluent Conference App 2016

"Fluent was the most beneficial conference I have attended as a web developer." – Jason Gill, Degreed

^ I want this quote to apply to me too.

As a budding front-end web developer, Fluent directly addresses the tools and topics I need to learn about. As a developer, I have the responsibility to keep up with the times and update my skills whenever necessary. It's what I love most about the work I do - the constant change of it all and how no one can ever really claim expertise for too long a time.

As a graduating CS major, I'm just about to embark on my new career for web development/design. Going to such a tight niche conference like Fluent would really set on my right path to a good start in my career.

I will also note that I'm making it my personal goal this year to attend more tech conferences since I realized that every time I've attended one, it's been ridiculously beneficial to my personal growth.
