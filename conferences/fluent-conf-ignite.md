Coding Bootcamps? Try Coding Schools.

---

Nowadays, there are coding bootcamps popping up everywhere around the world that promise to turn the average person to the ideal junior-level developer. But what if you want even more?

Coding bootcamps are intensive, accelerated learning programs that teach beginners digital skills like Full-Stack Web Development, Data Science, Digital Marketing, and UX/UI Design. Since Dev Bootcamp first opened their doors in February 2012, the coding bootcamp industry has grown throughout the US and around the world. Bootcamps can vary in length from 6 to 28 weeks (2 to 7 months), although the average bootcamp is ~10 weeks (2.5 months) long.

Inspired by this model, even longer programs that are at least 2 years long that serve to replace the entire college program (at least in tech) are recently starting to appear. I will be talking about two such examples - the Holberton School which had its first cohort this January (in 2016) and Make School which had its first cohort in September 2015.

These programs not only threaten the existence of lower quality CS programs but also challenge the reasoning students may have behind paying so much money for a CS degree that is not worth much in the end in terms of skills acquired.

Given that I'm currently looking at such alternative programs, I'm looking forward to exploring this topic.
