## Step 4 - Technical Screen

Okay so this is where I have some spicy üå∂Ô∏è takes.

A personal pet peeve of mind is being asked to do a Leetcode after working in the industry for nearly 6 years.

I believe whiteboarding interviews value memorization over the practical application of skills and are overly performative and disjoint from actual engineering work.

**HOWEVER, being picky about how you‚Äôre interviewed is not something everyone can afford to engage in.**

IMO, the more years of experience and the more big name companies you have on your resume, the more flexibility you have in your job search.

For technical screens, you can either:

1. Grind on Leetcode until you get good enough that you can do a DSA medium level difficulty problem with relative ease, or
2. Refuse to do Leetcode type interviews

<aside>
üåÄ More and more companies are offering candidates a choice (e.g. Leetcode problem pair programming session or take home project) so always ask in your recruiter call if that‚Äôs an option if you prefer either or.

</aside>

Now, it‚Äôs worth noting almost all the FAANG type companies use Leetcode. Why? Because when you have a zillion people applying for a position, Leetcode type problems scale pretty well.
