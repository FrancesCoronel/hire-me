# 03 - Recruiter Call {docsify-ignore}

> So a recruiter reached out and wants to interview. Congrats! ðŸŽ‰
>
> Here are some aspects I discuss in length when it comes to interviews...

- preparing ahead of time for the interview
- introducing yourself in an intriguing way
- being prepared to answer the behavioral questions the interviewer may ask
- **always always** asking questions
- following up

Try to do a phone call if possible. A phone call is more low key and allows you to read off information if youâ€™re struggling to find the right words.

Generally, the recruiter call is more of a formality but can be used to weed out candidates who may not be the right fit.

## Topics the recruiter may cover

1. Whatâ€™s top of mind for the company
2. More information on the role
3.

## Questions the recruiter may ask

1. Tell me about yourself

    You need to have this down pact

    Share your name, current position and what type of projects/skills youâ€™re working with

    Share a brief overview of your previous roles

    Share a little bit about your personal life

2. Why are you interested in [Company Name]?

    Watch videos, read their engineering blog and weave your personal motivations to form a compelling answer

3. Tell me more about your experience at [previous company] or with [specific skill from JD]
4. Does the salary range work for you? What are your salary expectations?

    Never provide your salary expectations upfront. Always ask for a range. If itâ€™s too low, move on.

## Questions you can ask

1. What is the salary range (unless it was already provided)
2. How are the engineering teams organized
3.

Refer to Key Values for a list of great questions.

ðŸ’° Make sure you know the salary range before moving on to the technical screen. You may go through the entire interview process and realize the salary they can offer is way too low for your needs.
