# Introducing Yourself

> Whether it's for a cover letter or meeting in-person, you should practice introducing yourself.
>
> Every company at some point is going to ask you that question at some point so it's ideal to have a decent answer and know it cold.

A bare bones guideline to how to introduce yourself includes covering the following talking points...

- Present
  - What are you up to now? What does your job entail? What excites you about working there?
- Past
  - How did you get to where you are now? What did you study? Have you taught yourself anything?
- Future
  - What are you hoping to get from this company in this role? Where do you see yourself long-term?
