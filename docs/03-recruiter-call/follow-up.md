Dear [interviewer],

It was great meeting you today and I appreciate you taking the time to interview me.

I really enjoyed learning more about (insert what new tidbit you learned about the company). This only solidified my interest in [company].

I look forward to hearing back!

Best,

## Did the company ghost you?

Sometimes companies will show promising interest to you through any step of their hiring process, and then completely stop responding. It can be frustrating, especially for early-career developers who are craving a lot of feedback. The following is a guideline of how to check in with a company if it's been a bit since you've heard from them.

Perhaps you have the email of the hiring manager or someone in human resources. You should reach out to them with the following guidelines:
- 5 days after the last interview -- this helps to keep the process moving. One business week has passed.
    - > Hello [Name],  Just following up on [role] at [Company name]. Are there any updates regarding the next steps?
- 10 days after the last interview -- Okay, two business weeks have passed, so hopefully, they respond to you now.
   - > Hello [Name],   Checking back in to see if you have any updates on [role] at [Company name]. My last interview with the company was on [date], and I was told I'd hear a response soon. [Restate your interest in the role]. I look forward to hearing back with updates.
- 15 days after the last interview -- this may be a stale lead.
   - > Hello [Name],  How are you doing today? It's been a few weeks since we last spoke, but I'm curious about if there are any updates with [role] at [Company name]. If this position has been filled, perhaps we can chat about other opportunities at [Company Name].
- 30 days after the last interview or line of communication -- this lead is done, and it's probably better to consider looking to other options.
