### Declining to Answer

These are a few sentences I took from the book, [Fearless Salary Negotiation](http://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/), on how to respond to a recruiter who tries to ask you what your previous salary was at your last gig.

> I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company rather than what I’m paid at my current job.

> I don’t have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and you know better than I do what value my skill set and experience could bring to your company.
>
> I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.
