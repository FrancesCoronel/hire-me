# Step 2 - Search {docsify-ignore}

## Setting Expectations

As you begin your job search, you need to set your expectations and your standards

You can sort of apply anywhere you can and go for the first offer you get and be cool with that because at least it’s a full-time job with an okay salary.

Or you can bide your time and wait until you can get multiple offers before choosing one.

This really depends on your needs and how long you can spend on the job search.

I’d say if you’re job searching for **4 months** and still don’t haven’t gotten any offers you like, you need to change your strategy or your standards.

> Searching for the ideal job position is tedious but here are a few resources to help you get started.
