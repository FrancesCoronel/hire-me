# Company Research {docsify-ignore}

Once you've decided on which companies you want to interview with, make sure to do your research to ensure yourself that it'd be a good fit.

This is also a necessary step to take right before the actual interview itself.

## Google

* Are they in the news?
  * What's the latest?
  * Any red flags?

## Company Website

* Familiarize yourself with their tech stack.
* Check out their company culture page.
* Read their “About Us” page.
* Familiarize yourself with their team page.
  * What are they wearing? Casual, business casual or formal?

## LinkedIn

* Research existing people at these companies that have your desired role and check out their personal websites, GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles to get a feel of what their background is.
* By checking the company's page on LinkedIn, you might find out you already know someone relevant that can provide a warm intro.
* Check out the people who you will be interviewing with.
* Look at the extra information posted on the company page.
* Follow the company if you're so inclined.

## Glassdoor­

* Skim over company reviews.
  * Note if anything extremely positive or negative comes up consistently.
* Read through the relevant interview experiences.
  * It's easy to filter by specific position and get a lot of potential interview questions the company will actually ask you.

## Crunchbase

* How many rounds of funding has the company had so far? From who?
* How many people work there?
* Who's part of the leadership team (CEO, CTO, etc.)?
  * Do they have a good reputation?
