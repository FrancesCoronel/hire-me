## Job Alerts

I personally enjoyed using LinkedIn & Glassdoor since you can setup customized job alerts.

## Job Tracking

Keep track of all the jobs you apply to using a platform like the ones below.

Airtable is my favorite option.

### Airtable

Instead of going through the hassle of using Excel, I would recommending trying out [Airtable](http://airtable.com) instead which supports a Kanban like board and has a better user experience than Excel.

### Huntr

[Huntr](http://huntr.co/) keeps track of every detail about your job applications - notes, dates, tasks, job descriptions, salaries, locations, company data and more.

### Indeed

[Indeed's Chrome Extension](https://chrome.indeed.com/) is a free service that helps you manage the status of your job applications on Indeed and other sites across the web.

It knows when to save your jobs, the jobs you applied to and even jobs that you interviewed and got hired for within one location.

### JobHero

The [JobHero](https://gojobhero.com/app/) dashboard allows you to

- save jobs from across the web and track your application progress,
- set reminders for follow ups, deadlines, and due dates and
- upload and tag documents, notes, and contact information.

### Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) keeps track of everything, from the big picture to the minute details.
