## Negotiating Salary

Create a minimum salary target for every company and change accordingly based on job type.

Get asking asking for a better salary from companies you feel you could get offers for but don't necessarily want to work for.

Make sure to consider not just `base salary` when considering offers, but also benefits, equity, bonuses, etc.

Many companies like to offer the total package number first which includes bonuses and other benefits.

Make sure to take potential taxes into account. ðŸ’¸
