### Timing

If you donâ€™t hear back **within 5 business days** of your last interview, you probably did not get the job.

If you hear back and they tell you they need more time to deliberate, assume itâ€™s a no as well. Some companies will drag candidates along for weeks because that candidate is not their top choice and they are trying to get more candidates in the pipeline before making a decision. In these situations, itâ€™s highly unlikely you will get the role so itâ€™s better to **move on mentally and keep applying**.
