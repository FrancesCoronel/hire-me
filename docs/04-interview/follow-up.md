## Following Up

It's good practice to send a quick follow-up email to your interviewer afterwards.

It's not absolutely necessary of course but it does create a positive impression.

Dear [interviewer],

It was great meeting you today and I appreciate you taking the time to interview me.

I really enjoyed learning more about (insert what new tidbit you learned about the company). This only solidified my interest in [company].

I look forward to hearing back!

Best,
