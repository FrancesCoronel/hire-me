## Jeopardy Template

> https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/jeopardy-template/


My mom is a Spanish high school teacher and she was frustrated trying to create a Jeopardy template using PPT. I told her I would make her one and as a result I created a version for not just Google Slides (which is much nicer than PPT in my opinion) but also a version for Keynote. I published it last year and so far it’s gotten almost 16K hits across the web just based off my Behance, Speaker Deck, and bit.ly link stats I made for them. Over 170 people have reached out via Google Slides attempting to get edit access (I have the emails to prove this). It got to the point where I had to set up an automatic reply for anyone trying to do this in order to show them how to make a copy that they could edit themselves on Google Slides.

## Alienware Desktop

This is a customization I made for my Mac two years ago back when it was easier to customize such things. Even though I’ve never used an Alienware computer, I think their design is really cool so I based it off that. I chose this project not because its technically challenging but because the concept of customization in general is very appealing to me and I apply to a lot of aspects in my life. In other words, I have always have believed customized, tailored solutions are much cooler and what I generally find more enjoyable in whatever environment I’m working in.

## MapMe Coding Bootcamps

I don't know if this would necessarily be deemed technical but I did help create a map of all the coding bootcamps out there because I didn't see any existing solution in place. I myself have attended It's gotten over 16K hits on Google Maps alone but I recently created a crowd-sourced version as well. Either way, both of these are the two top results on Google for the search query "map of coding bootcamps".
