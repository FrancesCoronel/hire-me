# Interview Checklist {docsify-ignore}

> Your on-site interview has been scheduled.
>
> So what's the plan? 🤔️

## Day Before

* Review your resume.
* Prepare and write down questions to ask the company.
  * I'd recommend having some kind of structure to how you do this since you may end up interviewing with a crap ton of companies.

> For On Site Interviews

* Check to make sure you're ready to go in terms of transportation and arriving on time.
* Pick a decent outfit based off what you've learned on company culture.
  * Business casual is usually the safe option here.
* Get some damn sleep. No one wants to interview a zombie.

## Day Of

* Eat some food beforehand, you don't want your interviewers to hear your tummy growling.
* Call someone you like a lot and talk to them so you're not as nervous beforehand and you remember what it's like to communicate with another human.
* Pop a breath mint in.
* Put your cell on "Do Not Disturb" mode.
* Ask some damn good and relevant questions.
  * If you're that one person who says they don't have any questions, that's a huge turn-off to recruiters.
* Eye contact and body language are important. Present yourself as open and confident.
* No slouching.
* Ask when you should expect to hear back.

## Day After

* Send a thank you email to your recruiter and interviewers if possible.

## A Few Days After

* Follow up if you haven't heard back.
  * The day of the interview, you should have asked when you should expect to hear back so if you haven't heard back from the recruiter, make sure to send a friendly email asking for an update.
