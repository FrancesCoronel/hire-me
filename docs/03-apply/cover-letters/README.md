# Cover Letter {docsify-ignore}

> Cover letters can be quite annoying since many recruiters tend to not read them but for the companies that **require** one, creating a relevant cover letter is vital could lead to a much better response.

> Also, cover letters can serve as ideal cold emails if you're trying to reach out to a recruiter you met in person.

## Template - Existing Connection

It's always more ideal to reach out to recruiters where there's some kind of mutual connection.

Hi [recruiter you met],

I’m [your name]. It was a real pleasure chatting with you at the rooftop mixer at [company name] last weekend. I found your contact info on LinkedIn, and it turns out we both know [mutual friend], a friend of mine from working at [past company] last summer.

I am a huge fan of the [company] app and I especially love the [insert aspect of the app] and the culture there. I worked on similar projects before which you can check out here: [insert portfolio link]. Based off my previous experience, [talk about how previous experience relates to this role].

I've actually created this [project description] that uses [company tech stack] which ideally can showcase my relevant skill set.

Would you be interested in meeting up to chat further? I am currently located in San Francisco, where your company is headquartered.

Best,

[your name]
[contact info]

## Template - No Connection

If you have no connection with the company, it's up to you to present your best self and how you can best benefit the company.

Dear [company],

This letter is to express my interest in your posting on [job board] for [position].

After looking through what [company] wants out of this position, I am confident I'm a great match.

[Elaborate on academic qualifications and previous experience and how it ties to job requirements]

I've actually created this [project description] that uses [company tech stack] which can more ideally showcase my relevant skill set.

## Tips

* Don't regurgitate your resume
* Mention a specific thing that appeals to you about working for that specific company
* The first paragraph should directly state what position you're applying for
* If you know someone at the company, now would be the time to mention them.
* Share an idea you have that you think would be valuable for the company or even try to provide some help/criticism (I noticed a bug on your website...)
* Make sure it's less than one page.
* Share experiences that demonstrate how prepared you are for the job.
* Provide relevant contact info (GitHub, LinkedIn, phone #, email, etc.)
