# Replying to Recruiters

> Okay, so you got a recruiter to reach out to you. That's great!

> Now you got to make sure to reply back to them in a timely manner.

## Scheduling

One of the first questions you'll get from them of course is when you're available to talk/video chat/whatever.

I personally use [Calendly](http://calendly.com) for this process and it works wonders.

I'd recommend trying it out yourself since it's free.

## Email Template

Here's a reply template you can use to follow up.

```markdown
Hi [Name of recruiter]

Thanks for reaching out - I'm very excited to learn more about [Company Name]

So in terms of setting up a time to chat, I actually have a Calendly where you're more than welcome to see when I'll be available this week or next.

Looking forward to hearing back!

## Has a recruiter ghosted you?

It happens pretty often, unfortunately. A conversation begins with a recruiter and it sounds very promising, but then there's radio silence!

Always keep in mind the value of what you're aiming to achieve out of speaking with a company. Is it a job? Is it for interview practice? Is it to get to know the company? Everyone has different needs, so be sure you understand yours.
I recommend sending polite emails to recruiters to check up on the lead.
- 5 days after last communication -- this helps to keep the process moving. One business week has passed.
    - > Hello Recruiter,  Just following up on [role] at [Company name]. Are there any updates regarding the next steps?
- 10 days after last communication -- Okay, two business weeks have passed, so hopefully, they respond to you now.
   - > Hello Recruiter,   Checking back in to see if you have any updates on [role] at [Company name]. I'm still very interested in applying. Please let me know if any materials are needed to help with the process!
- 15 days after last communication -- this may be a stale lead.
   - > Hello Recruiter,  How are you doing today? It's been a few weeks since we last spoke, but I'm curious about if there are any updates with [role] at [Company name]. If this position has been filled, perhaps we can chat about other opportunities that have come down the pipeline!
- 30 days after last communication -- this lead is done, and it's probably better to consider looking to other options.
   - > Hello Recruiter, We spoke last month about some promising openings as a [role]. Just checking in to see what new leads you have.
   - Alternatively, a lot of tech recruiting agencies have many employees working, so you could also try doing some LinkedIn sleuthing to find a coworker who you can contact for any new leads.
