## Resume

Consider your resume a living document that has continuous updates, tweaks, and versions. If your job search has been a lengthy one with many rejections, take time to evaluate your resume and see if it is best capturing you as a worthy candidate. Begin A/B testing resumes with different companies, to see if there's one version with a better response. This testing can work great when applying on [job boards](02-search/README.md).

Always take time to edit and proofread your resume. When you've polished it to an approving status, have another person read it for feedback. Additionally, if you're working with a recruiter directly, they would be an excellent person to ask for feedback on how your resume stands.

Lastly, print out your resume to see if the formatting is appropriate on both physically and digitally. There have been times I worked on an awesome resume, only to find my font prints out very small.

### Creddle

I would recommend using an online platform like [Creddle](http://creddle.io/) to avoid the tedious process of making a resume from scratch.
