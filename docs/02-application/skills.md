## Skills

> Ensuring whoever looks through your profile has a good idea of what you have experience in is pretty important.

## LinkedIn - Featured Skills & Endorsements

If you haven't already, add your relevant skills to your LinkedIn profile as well under the **Featured Skills & Endorsements** section and try and get endorsements from your peers.

## Reference List

Some of the more _vintage_ application platforms out there still require you to list out your skills.

Unfortunately, this may actually be important since some platforms use this as a basis to decide/filter out whether an applicant knows the right technologies for the role.

I would recommend keeping a list of skills in your note taking app for quick reference like this.
