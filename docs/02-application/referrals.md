## Referrals

Use your connections to find someone you may know at the company (1st to 3rd connections on LinkedIn) to get a warm intro whenever possible.

In my experience, warm intros are by far the most effective way to get you an initial interview.

If you put yourself in the recruiter's shoes, you'll quickly realize that it would be way nicer to have referrals sent to you instead of looking over hundreds (or thousands) of resumes.

An easy way of figuring out if you know someone at the company is via LinkedIn and using their filtering options.

As an example, here I'm trying to find a **1st connection** on LinkedIn that **lives in the US** and works for **Google**.

Now I have a better idea of the folks I can reach out to if I ever want to try and get a job at Google.

### Pay to Play

I donâ€™t personally condone these platforms but the tech industry has a pretty dodgy moral compass so yep.
