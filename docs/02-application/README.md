# Step 2 - Application {docsify-ignore}

It's time to apply for the position!

Getting a referral first and then submitting a well crafted resume will increase your changes of getting to the next round after applying.

The “Application” stage is when you can either

1. submit your resume online through the company’s career page, or
2. get a referral and have your resume shared with the relevant hiring team

**Either way, your resume is pretty much what will make or break this stage.**

Assume the recruiter spends a minute looking at your resume before deciding whether to send their call availability.

## Formatting Your Resume

I’d recommend using a third party tool to format your resume.

I’d also proofread your resume using Grammarly and get at least 1 pair of eyes on it to get feedback before putting it on into the wild.

### Creddle.io

It’s a bit of an older tool, but I still use it to create my PDF resume, so I don't have to worry about formatting.

## Tracking Your Applications

Just like recruiters rely on a tool like Ashby to track all their candidates, you need to have your own tool to track what positions you’re applying to or are interested in.

It’s important you make a note of the following

- job position
- company name
- job description
- salary range
- location
- whether’s it remote friendly or not

You want to make note of this because they may take down the position at some point and you want to make sure you have that reference.
